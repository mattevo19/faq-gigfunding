        question: "Is Gigfunding free to use?",
        answer: "Yes! It is a free service with no fees for individuals or the causes we champion. As a UK registered non-profit organisation, we use a PAY-WHAT-YOU-FEEL revenue model and invite you to give between 0 to 20 % of your payment to Gigfunding; so we can continue to keep the platform running. We like to practice what we preach and rely on the same method of fundraising we offer causes. Like the causes we champion, Gigfunding relies on its community and donations to thrive",

        question: "Does Gigfunding receive other funding?",
        answer: "Currently the project is completely self-funded, and run by a team of like-minded and enthusiastic volunteers. As well as donations, in our first year (2017) we won £15,000 of grant funding, and have gratefully received £1645 through crowdfunding too. We are in the process of applying for private investment loans, to see us through our first 3 years of startup, to self-sustainability. Check out our Investment deck if you want to know the ins and outs.",

        question: "How does Gigfunding work?",
        answer: "Use our online marketplace to hire or volunteer skills through the site. Currently gigs will focus on the virtual side, but as we hope to return to a more familiar life the possibilities will be endless - dog walking, cooking classes, the Gigfunding world will be your oyster. The skills for hire will cost market rates, and the money is donated to the causes the hirer and volunteer choose. See How it works for more detail.",

        question: "What are Gigfundings goals?",
        answer: "Society is changing, fundraising must too. We want to put the fun back in fundraising, creating a community of changemakers to drive positive social change through truly worthwhile causes.<br></br>As soon as possible, we want to enable Gift-Aid on our donations to charities as this will generate considerably more money for all the causes. <br></br>We plan to build relationships with corporations who want to discount skills for disadvantaged hirers. We love the idea that neighbours with less financial freedom can still get access to the skills they require and desire, particularly upskilling related gigs.<br></br>We want people to eventually be able to choose multiple causes on their profile. This is currently limited by our manual process of payments and accounting. <br></br>We want to enable digitally excluded members to have access to the site via tablets set up in community centres and charity shops.<br></br>We want to enable our causes to have access to the highly skilled individuals, via pro-bono match making. This too would need a form of corporate sponsorship.",

        question: "Will this take paid jobs away from small business owners?",
        answer: "There could be some instances of this, but only a small percentage. The overall positive impact of the deed is the key aspect and fees won’t be undercutting market rates.<br></br>We think that more skills will be hired because of the fundraising element, creating requests that would otherwise not have been hired at all<br></br> <i>Eg. Sarah wants her wall repainted, but can’t justify spending £100 to do it. However, now she knows about Gigfunding, she can feel content in spending the money, as she knows all the money is going to local causes she loves. The painter might only offer the job as a one off, for the year, but Sarah could hire them again, or recommend them to a friend external to Gigfunding, giving the painter a new paying client.</i><br></br>We also feel many of the gigs will be tasks that would have normally been favours; eg. Watering your neighbor's plants, doing that job for a mate or walking your friend’s dog.",

        question: "Why can’t people earn some money through the platform?",
        answer: "We decided we didn’t want to begin with this model, as we felt it might attract people to the platform who were more incentivised by their own income, than giving or connecting with others. We want to power social change through honest fundraising and genuine altruism.<br></br>We are however considering adding this feature at a later stage and we will listen to our community to help us decide the direction we take in this area, of course",

        question: "Are the gigs insured?",
        answer: "Gigfunding does not currently insure gigs as we can’t yet afford to create this feature. We strongly advise you to seek out your own insurance as a hirer and volunteer; AND to check the other party has insurance too. Like we said, we’re not into bungee jumps or skydives and at this early stage we don’t allow high risk gigs to be arranged through the platform. We are exploring our options for insurance at a later date in our development but especially for now we want fundraising to be easy and enjoyable for all involved.",

We check users’ profiles and monitor the site and listings, however do emphasise the importance of using your own judgement. Take every necessary precaution you would when going on a first date. Meet in public spaces, ask for professional reviews, insurance proof, verified identities on other sites etc. Okay, maybe not quite like a first date. But if you at any point feel unsafe with the person you’re meeting with, walk away and do not worry, we will refund you.",

This might be carers, children, friends or neighbours - anyone that can help. We ask that when you post in this way, you make it explicit that this is on behalf of someone else, and it will then be up to the other person to take the necessary precautions to ensure safety.<br></br>As we grow as a community and organisation, we have some of the ideas make Gigfunding more digitally inclusive as soon as possible:<br></br><b>Charity Events</b><br></br>We plan to attend events, once events are back, that are set-up by the causes being fundraised for on Gigfunding. This way we can meet people face to face who are keen to join in, spread the goals and visions of Gigfunding further and post hiring or volunteering skills on their behalf.<br></br><b>Charity shop & community centre tablets</b><br></br>We will set up tablets in easy to reach places to create access points to Gigfunding. Charity shops make the most sense, as they can have their cause on the platform, giving them a new avenue of fundraising. We can also train the shopkeepers to guide people through the site to support those who struggle with digital access.<br></br><b>Community Phone Line</b><br></br>We want to continue to harness the collective power and generosity of our community, which is why we plan to have a volunteer led phone line. This will enable other users to sign up digitally excluded neighbours and friends. This way, even if someone only has a phone, or difficulties accessing the web, they can join in with our community of changemakers at Gigfunding.<br></br><b>What if I have a complaint?</b><br></br>While we aim to give you a positive and kind experience whenever you interact with us or another member of the Gigfunding community, we understand that things don’t always go according to the plan. We view all complaints positively as they are one of the ways we have to make sure we keep improving our customer kindness standards and building a global community of active and connected citizens.<br></br>Often the easiest way for you to register a complaint, and for us to resolve it, is via our online chat box. Simply get in touch with one of our community kindness advocates and they will record your complaint on the spot, We are online everyday from 9:00-18:00.<br></br>All formal complaints are directed to Lana, Head of Community Kindness here at Gigfunding, to ensure they receive a high priority. You can also contact us via the form here.<br></br>We would appreciate your understanding that, with limited resources, we cannot always respond to your complaint immediately, although we will whenever we can. You’ll receive an initial acknowledgement and/or response within 3 working days of receipt of your complaint and we expect to resolve most problems within 5 working days time. Where a more in-depth solution is required we aim to provide a full response within 3 weeks. If there are exceptional circumstances, where that is not possible, we will advise you.",
